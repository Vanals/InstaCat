## InstaCat

InstaCat is a web app that, given a JSON file containing photos information, shows you a feed of cats pictures. You can hide temporary the feed if you want and then you can click on a picture and write a comment, put a like, see the author's name and avatar and last but not least appreciate the picture in a bigger size.
This project has been done using React as front-end technology.
This app is not responsive yet, it'll only be perfectly CSS'ED' on a MacBook Pro 15inch.
